HuskClaims provides several API events your plugin can listen to when players do certain town-related things. These events deal in HuskClaims class types, so you may want to familiarize yourself with the [API basics](API) first. Note that on cross-server setups, events only fire on the *server the event occurred on* and will not fire as a result of API calls/updates.

## Bukkit Platform Events
> **Tip:** Remember to register your listener when listening for these event calls.
